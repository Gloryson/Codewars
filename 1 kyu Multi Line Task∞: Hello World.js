You need to write a function f that returns the string Hello, world!.

Requirement: Every line must have at most 1 character, and total number of lines must be less than 145.

Hint: It's possible to complete this in less than 99 (tsukumo) lines.

Trivia: While âˆž can be pronounced as infinity, it's preferred to be pronounced as mugen here. It's the same, but way cooler.
